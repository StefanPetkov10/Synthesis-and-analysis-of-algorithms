## ðŸ“‹ Features  
### Sorting Algorithms  
This repository implements **all major sorting algorithms**, including:  
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm for small datasets.  
- **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element in each pass and places it in its correct position.  
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the sorted portion of the array one element at a time.  
- **Cocktail Sort**: A bi-directional Bubble Sort that reduces iterations by sorting in both directions during each pass.  
- **Shell Sort**: A generalization of Insertion Sort, using a gap sequence to improve performance.
